Sound Computing and Sensor Technology: Creating an Interactive Audio Installation for Roskilde Festival Edit

Add topics

This Github page is for the implementation of Mediaolgy group 408's semester project for spring 2017.

The project will (probably) be written mostly in Arduino's IDE, and maybe MATLAB.

Before coding, make sure to check about adding a .gitIgnore file for Arduino or Matlab (don't know if we will need one at all)
