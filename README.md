Sound Computing and Sensor Technology: Creating an Interactive Audio Installation for Roskilde Festival Edit

Add topics

This Github page is for the implementation of Mediaolgy group 408's semester project for spring 2017.

The project will (probably) be written mostly in Arduino's IDE, and maybe MATLAB.

The code used for the final test can be found in the folder: Effects_And_Sounds_Working_with_Piezo.ino. The other folders are a result of the iterative development process.
